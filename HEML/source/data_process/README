typically the order of operations here is 
0) get pdbs/download_pdbs.py
0+) python pull_het_ligands.py
1) pychimera chimera_docking.py
2) python get_charges.py
3) python process_charges.py
4) python run_cpet_box_calc.py/run_top_single.py
then whatever post processing you need



Once you have your list of compressed proteins and the structures you want to compute high-level qm/mm calculations on, run the following: 

1) phd3_process.py --> pulls out heme from MD frame, converts to pdb
2) addh.py --> adds hydrogens to core heme and then produces input files for phd3/turbomol
